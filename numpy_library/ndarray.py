'''An instance of ndarray class can be constructed by different array creation routines described later in the tutorial. 
The basic ndarray is created using an array function in NumPy as follows âˆ’
`numpy.array `
It creates an ndarray from any object exposing array interface, or from any method that returns an array.
`numpy.array(object, dtype = None, copy = True, order = None, subok = False, ndmin = 0)`
'''

import numpy as np 
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a)

# more than one dimensions
b = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
print(b)
# minimum dimensions 
c = np.array([1,2,3,4,5], ndmin=2)
print(c)
# dtype parameter 
a = np.array([1,2,3,4], dtype=complex)
print(a)
